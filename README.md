# Headless Sbanken login
This script allows for programmatic login into Sbanken using NPM package Playwright.

## Setup
1. Run `npm install`
1. Copy file `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in form
2. Run `node index.js` and inspect the screenshots continuosly written to the screenshots-folder

## The why?
Idk, I wanted to see if it was possible to do a programmatic login that will handle BankID. I also thought about an automattic renewal of my Sbanken API tokens since I'm lazy.
